## A note on versions

The documentation on this site aims to track the _latest version_ of Academic. 

For _previous versions_ of Academic, one can travel back in time via the GitHub [repository for this site](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-www). Simply note the [date of your version](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/releases), and view the Markdown pages in the [repository for this site](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-www) shortly after that point in time.
