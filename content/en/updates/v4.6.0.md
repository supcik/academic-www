## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the **epic** v4.6 release of Academic. There are a number of exciting updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- Based on your feedback, there's now an option to **disable linking authors to their profile page**
  - To disable author links, add `link_authors = false` to the _Advanced_ (or root) section of your `params.toml`
- **Improved robustness of search** to handle diacritics (accents) and Chinese/Korean/Japanese languages
- **New background image options for Widget Page sections**
  - `image_size` can be set to `cover` (default), `contain`, or `actual` size
  - `image_position` can be set to any valid CSS background position including `left`, `center` (default), or `right`
  - `image_parallax` makes the fun parallax-like fixed background effect optional by setting to `true` or `false`
- **Integrated [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com)**, allowing for very powerful analytics without needing to modify any code
- The [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) integration now uses the modern `gtag.js` approach and only collects data in production (your live site)
- A person's social links can now be shown in the [**People widget**]({{< relref "../docs/page-builder.md#people" >}})
  - See _Breaking Changes_ section below
- The **semantic address format can now be localised**
  - For example, US sites can use the US address format and Chinese sites can use the Chinese address format.
  - A default `address_format` can be set in `params.toml` (see *Breaking Changes* section below), which can be overriden on a per page basis using a parameter of the same name in a page's front matter.
  - Optionally, multilingual sites may wish to add a default format for each site in `languages.toml`.
- **Mention users** in content using the new Mention shortcode
  - To mention someone, type `{{%/* mention "username" */%}}` where `username` corresponds to a user account in Academic.
- **Significant speed up in page load when using math** due to upgrade from MathJax v2 to v3
- Apply **live day/night update on system prefs change** (no need for refresh)
- **Redesign of mobile-first menu**
  - **On mobile, position toggle on left and logo in centre** (adopt standard)
  - **Show Search, Day/Night, and Language icons in mobile menu bar**
  - Add **option to align menu items to left, centre, or right** (see *Breaking Changes* section below)
  - Add **option to remove logo image/text from menu** (see *Breaking Changes* section below)
  - Add **automatic menu dropdowns on mouseover** for desktop
- **Significantly improved search relevance** for queries containing diacritics or Chinese, Korean, and Japanese languages

## Breaking changes

**Hugo Extended v0.58.3+ is now required.**

### Params.toml

**Configuration**

To help guide you through the upgrade process, you can [view the changes to the demo `params.toml` file](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/compare/v4.5.0...v4.6.0#diff-8b291e059fa3d9923251f60f22e0ef49) by opening the link, clicking the *Files Changed* tab, and then searching the page in your web browser for changes to the `exampleSite/config/_default/params.toml` file.

**Changes to address formatting**

- `list_delimiter` removed from `params.toml`
- `address_format` added to the *Regional* section in `params.toml`:
    ```toml
    # Address format (choose from the [address_formats] list below or add you own to the list).
    address_format = "en-us"
    ```
- `[address_formats]` added to the **end** of the *Advanced* section in `params.toml`:
    ```toml
    # Available address formats.
    [address_formats]
      en-us = {order = ['street', 'city', 'region', 'postcode'], delimiters = [', ', ', ', ' ', '']}
      en-gb = {order = ['street', 'city', 'region', 'postcode'], delimiters = [', ', ', ', ', ', '']}
      zh = {order = ['postcode', 'region', 'city', 'street'], delimiters = [' ', ' ', ' ', '']}
    ```

**Changes to main menu options**

The `menu_align_right` option has been removed and the following `main_menu` options have been added to the *Advanced* section of `params.toml`.

```toml
# Main menu alignment (l = left, c = center, r = right) and logo options.
main_menu = {align = "l", show_logo = true}
```

**If you wish to use Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager**, then add the following at the end of the file, including your associated tracking code:

```toml
############################
## Marketing
############################
[marketing]
  google_analytics = ""
  google_tag_manager = ""
```

Note that the old `googleAnalytics` option in `config.toml` is still supported, but may be deprecated in a future version.

GA now only tracks users on your live _production_ website. Hugo's default environments are `development` with the `hugo serve` command and `production` with the `hugo` command. You can explicitly set the environment to production with `HUGO_ENV` or Hugo's `--environment` [option](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_env/#readout). If you deploy with Netlify, check that your Netlify settings in `netlify.toml` are similar to the [latest Netlify settings in the Academic Kickstart template](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart/blob/master/netlify.toml).

Due to the changes in GA implementation, we recommend testing that your analytics are still working as expected. If they are not, check that your production environment is as described above and check that your URL in your GA admin panel matches your site's URL.

If you choose to use GA via Google Tag Manager instead (`google_tag_manager`), it will override the direct GA implementation (`google_analytics`) to prevent tracking each user twice.

**Linking Authors**

Under the _Advanced_ (root) section, you can optionally add the option for **linking authors** (default is _true_):

```toml
# Link authors to their profile page? (true/false)
link_authors = true
```

**New approach to applying custom style (CSS)**

1. Create the `assets/scss/` folder if it doesn't exist
2. Create a file named `custom.scss`
3. Add your custom CSS code to the file you created and re-run Hugo to view changes

The old `plugins_css` approach in `params.toml` is now deprecated.

### People widget

If you are using the _People_ widget, then you'll need to upgrade your settings. User Groups have moved under `[content]` and additional options have been added under `[design]`:

```toml
widget = "people"  # Use the People widget
headless = true  # This file represents a page section.

# ... Put Your Section Options Here (title etc.) ...

[content]
  # Choose which groups/teams of users to display.
  #   Edit `user_groups` in each user's profile to add them to one or more of these groups.
  user_groups = ["Principal Investigators",
                 "Researchers",
                 "Grad Students",
                 "Administration",
                 "Visitors",
                 "Alumni"]

[design]
  # Show user's social networking links? (true/false)
  show_social = false

  # Show user's interests? (true/false)
  show_interests = true
```

## Misc

- Moved social share buttons below content

## Fixes

- fix: Widget page: filter by tag/category breaks if there's a space in the tag/category name
- fix: Talk page: do not display 'event' field if it's empty
- fix: Hugo v0.58.0 breaks RSS template
- fix(publication): DOI link not shown if it's the only link
- fix: console error when clicking `back_to_top` button (did not affect _Back To Top_ functionality)
- fix: don't show address in Contact if it's an array of empty strings
  - An alternative is to comment out the `address` in Params if it's unused
