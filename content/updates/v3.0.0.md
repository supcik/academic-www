## Breaking changes

Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v2.4.0:

- Require Hugo **v0.49+**
- [View config changes](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/compare/v2.4.0...v3.0.0#files_bucket) in `config.toml` - scroll down to the changes for the `exampleSite/config.toml` file
  - apply the config changes to your site's `config.toml`
- Migrate icon pack names and [icon names](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) to Font Awesome v5 (for brands, use `fab` icon pack, otherwise `fas` icon pack for general icons)
  - Update icons in your `[[social]]` instances in `config.toml`
- Refactor a page named `X.md` to `content/<section>/X/index.md` to use the new [page bundles](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/) and featured image system
  - E.g. a post `content/post/X.md` is converted to `content/post/X/index.md`
- Talks and publications: internal `url_*` links are now relative to their directory (such as their page bundle )
  - If you have `url_*` links pointing to internal resources on your site, their path may need adjusting to be relative to their directory rather than relative to the website root
  
## Content pages

- **[Automatic generation of _cite_ and _PDF_ links](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#manually)**: drag and drop a `*.bib` and a PDF named after your publication's own folder (page bundle) to your publication's own folder
- New [*docs* layout](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#create-a-course-or-documentation) for **online courses, tutorials, software documentation, and knowledge bases** etc.
  - This website is using the new *docs* layout for the purpose of documenting Academic
- Multi-user support
  - Ability to add multiple authors for blog posts  
- Publication: Add optional DOI link using new `doi` option
- Talks and publications: make internal `url_` links relative to their page bundle 
- The following boolean (true/false) options can be added in the front matter of pages to **control page features**:
  - `share`
  - `comments`
  - `reading_time`
  - `profile`
