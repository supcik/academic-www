Welcome to the v4.5 release of Academic. There are a number of exciting updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

## Breaking changes

Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v4.4:

**Configuration**

To help guide you through the upgrade process, the latest demo configuration can be found at https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/exampleSite/config/_default .

**In your `config/_default/params.toml`:**

**Rename** the `color_theme` option to just `theme`.

**Rename** the *Default* `theme` and/or `font` set to *Minimal* if your were previously using the *Default* theme or font set.

The font set is now specified by themes. Therefore, **remove your current font** set by setting `font = ""`, **unless you wish to override the theme's font set** with one of the other installed font sets or your own (see Customization page in the docs).

**_Font size_ is now a site setting** rather than a setting within a theme. To change the font size now, `font_size` can be set to `XS`, S` (small), `M` (medium), `L` (large), or `XL` after your `font` setting in `params.toml`. For example, `font_size = "L"` (the default size).

**Add to the bottom of `config/_default/params.toml`:**

```toml
# Comments.
[comments]
  # Comment provider:
  #   0: Disabled
  #   1: Disqus (https://disqus.com)
  #   2: Commento (https://commento.io)
  engine = 0

  # Which page types are commentable?
  commentable = {page = true, post = true, docs = true}

  # Configuration of Disqus.
  [comments.disqus]
    shortname = ""  # Paste the shortname from your Disqus dashboard.
    show_count = true  # Show comment count in page header? (true/false)
```

*Editable* in `config/_default/params.toml` can now be set to allow visitors to edit more page types - *Page* and *Post* have been added:

```toml
edit_page = {repo_url = "https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO>", repo_branch = "master", editable = {docs = true, page = false, post = false}}
```

**Change the `[outputs]` section in your `config/_default/config.toml`** from:

```toml
[outputs]
  home = [ "HTML", "RSS", "JSON" ]
  section = [ "HTML", "RSS" ]
```

to

```toml
[outputs]
  home = [ "HTML", "RSS", "JSON", "WebAppManifest" ]
  section = [ "HTML", "RSS" ]

[mediaTypes."application/manifest+json"]
  suffixes = ["webmanifest"]

[outputFormats.WebAppManifest]
  mediaType = "application/manifest+json"
  rel = "manifest"
```

**Icons:**

If overriding icon.png, rename it to icon-32.png and add icon-512.png.

**Improvements to page front matter for pages, posts, and docs page types:**

* To override the global setting to enable or disable commenting on a page: `commentable: true` 
* To override the global setting to enable or disable editing of a page: `editable: true` 

### Changes to how contact details are stored

**If you are using the Contact widget, then the contact structure in `config/_default/params.toml` must be upgraded:**

**Convert** the `address` field into semantic parts:

- `address = ""` becomes `address = {street = "450 Serra Mall", city = "Stanford", region = "CA", postcode = "94305", country = "United States", country_code = "US"}`

**Latitude and longitude have moved** under the `coordinates` option:

- E.g. `coordinates = {latitude = "37.4275", longitude = "-122.1697"}`

**Map settings have moved** under the new `[map]` section at the end of [params.toml](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/exampleSite/config/_default/params.toml):

```
[map]
  # To show your address on a map in the Contact widget, enter your latitude and longitude (above)
  # and choose a map provider below.
  #
  # To use Google Maps, set `engine` to 1 and enter your API key that can be obtained here:
  #   https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
  # To use OpenStreetMap tiles, set `engine` to 2.
  # To use OpenStreetMap on a high traffic site, set `engine` to 3 and enter your API key that can be obtained here:
  #   https://www.mapbox.com/studio/account/tokens
  #
  # Map provider:
  #   0: No map
  #   1: Google Maps
  #   2: OpenStreetMap (Mapnik)
  #   3: OpenStreetMap (Mapbox)
  engine = 2
  api_key = ""
  zoom = 15
```

**Office hours** can now be specified more simply, as a list:

- `office_hours = ["Monday 10:00 to 13:00", "Wednesday 09:00 to 10:00"]`

## Misc

- style: fix aside to appear same as alert
  - To try, set `markup: mmark` in front matter and add `A> Some text` to a Markdown file's body
- feat(shortcode): **enable figure lightbox by default** - hover your mouse over a figure to enlarge it
- feat: add **Xing** option to Page Sharer
- feat: **add image to RSS feed**
- refactor: renamed `edit_page.html` to `page_edit.html`
- feat: add git _branch_ option for editing pages
- style: fix category icon and language icon spacing when Hugo's `--minify` is used
- fix: HTML of author page when there is no authored content
- added optional `list_delimiter` option to `params.toml` for formatting addresses

## Language Packs
