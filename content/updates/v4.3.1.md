You can also [file a bug report](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues). *Want to update to this version?* Refer to the [update guide]({{< relref "/docs/update.md" >}}) in conjunction with the parameter changes mentioned in the [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes) section below.

## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the v4.3.1 release of Academic. There are a number of exciting updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- **A listing page will be generated for your courses, tutorials, and documentation** - [view the new demo](https://academic-demo.netlify.com/courses/)
  - For when you have multiple files using the *docs* layout which are organized in a parent folder like `content/courses/python-101/`
  - The corresponding example Markdown files can be found [here](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/exampleSite/content/courses)
- **Active link highlighting** in the navigation bar has been **extended to work for non-home pages**
  - Active link highlighting and scrolling to navigation links now works with multiple widget-pages and any other pages such as those using the `docs` layout - check out the latest demo site to see it in action with the *Tutorials* page
- **Slides** - if you use code highlighting, the **code highlighting style can now be chosen on a per deck basis** to match the color theme of your slide deck (see [*Slides*](#slides) below)
- Converted CSS styling to **SCSS** for tighter integration with Bootstrap and Academic's theming system
  - This refactoring is unlikely to affect any custom CSS in *CSS Plugins*
- Added a search box to the 404 error page so that visitors can easily discover relevant content
- **Fixes** (see below) for **author system** including **author error on Windows** and fixes for some **tag/category links** that were broken by breaking changes in Hugo v0.55

Most front matter snippets in the documentation have recently been converted **[from TOML to YAML]({{< relref "front-matter.md" >}})**. The example widgets and configuration files remain in TOML format. There is no need to convert any files in your site since Academic and Hugo continue to support both YAML and TOML formats. An [online YAML<-->TOML converter is available](https://toolkit.site/format.html) should you wish to convert your front matter. This change is to make it easier to edit content in popular Markdown editors like [Typora](https://www.typora.io) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

## Breaking changes

Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v4.2:

- Rename the `author` folder to `authors`
- In `config/_default/config.toml`, remove `"CSS"` from the site `[outputs]` section, yielding:

    ```toml
    [outputs]
    home = [ "HTML", "RSS", "JSON" ]
    section = [ "HTML", "RSS" ]
    ```

- **If you deploy your site with Netlify**, login to Netlify and choose *Settings > Build & deploy > Build image selection* and choose *Ubuntu Xenial 16.04* as the build image. Previous Netlify build images do not fully support all Hugo features.
- If using the *docs* layout, add `layout: docs` in YAML (or `layout = "docs"` in TOML) to `content/courses/_index.md`

## Slides

The author of a slide deck can now choose a code highlighting style to match the color theme of the slide deck, if code highlighting is enabled in `config/_default/params.toml`.

For a *light* slide deck, consider adding the following to the bottom of your slide front matter:

```toml
[slides]
theme = "white"  # Reveal JS theme name
highlight_style = "github"  # Highlight JS theme name
```

Whereas, for a *dark* slide deck, consider adding the following to the bottom of your slide front matter:

```toml
[slides]
theme = "black"  # Reveal JS theme name
highlight_style = "dracula"  # Highlight JS theme name
```

Refer to the updated [docs]({{< relref "/docs/managing-content.md#create-slides" >}}) for further info.

## Pages

- fix: build fails on Windows: "Error: Could not find author page at..." (#1068)
- fix authors no longer shown on publication page
- fix some tag and category links broken
- fix: Hugo 0.54+ breaks links to user profiles with non-ASCII usernames
  - workaround the Hugo bug by performing a check to remove invalid links to user profiles (i.e. a normal, unlinked author name will be displayed in the page metadata in this case)

## Publications

- refactor publication types as TOML at `themes/academic/data/publication_types.toml`

## Widgets

- fix inconsistent column widths in People widget

## Shortcodes

- fix Gallery shortcode: remove Hugo 0.55+ deprecation warning

## Misc

- Update HighlightJS from 9.12.0 to 9.15.6 (#1075)
  - Adds **support for more languages** including *plaintext* and *SAS*
  - See https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/master/CHANGES.md
