## Breaking changes

Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v3.2.0:

- [View changes](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/compare/v3.2.0...v3.3.0#files_bucket) to `config.toml` - scroll down to the changes for the `exampleSite/config.toml` file
- Replace any instances of `\n` with `\\` in any multiline fields such as the `address` and `office_hours` fields in `config.toml`
  - Note that there is a [**bug in Hugo v0.53+**](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/852#issuecomment-450144889) affecting `\\` linebreaks; a workaround is to either *downgrade* Hugo to v0.50 or *replace* `\\` with `<br>`
- Upgrade the front matter of the Posts widget
  - [See the changes](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/commit/fbcb7f27618e7cc2c3e9a984fed6bde96f44c01e#diff-bbd6c40eb5d70c1e3d0a58fedc533c13)
  - Remove `tags_include` and `tags_exclude` from `home/posts.md`
  - Add `filter_tag` and `filter_category` to `home/posts.md`
- Save the [Accomplishments widget](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/master/exampleSite/content/home/accomplishments.md) to `home/accomplishments.md` if you would like to use it to list your accomplishments

## Other

- Updated FontAwesome icons from v5.4.1 to v5.6.0 - includes their [new Winter icon packs](https://fontawesome.com/icons?from=io)
